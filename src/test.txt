How I tested:
1. Created a local DB
2. Created a separate user
3. Opened Tableplus (DB Management Tool) and connected it to my local "store" DB
4. Prepared the DB connection and CRUD classes
5. Created a Main class which uses all four CRUD methods for the customers table
6. I then commented all method calls but one and executed the main method
7. Through Tableplus, I verified that a Customer record was created, updated and deleted
8. For get method, I had it print to the console the full name and address of the returned customer which I made sure were correct
